                        <h2><strong>$10 billion in aid pledged for Syrian refugee crisis</strong></h2>
                            <p>By JULIE HIRSCHFELD DAVIS  STEPHEN CASTLE</p>
                            <p>The New York Times</p>
                            <p>LONDON — With no end in sight to Syria’s nearly five-year civil war, rich nations pledged more than $10 billion Thursday to help millions of people who have been displaced by the conflict and to prepare for new waves of refugees expected this year.</p>
                            <p>The pledges of aid at a donors conference in London slightly exceeded the meeting’s goal, avoiding the failure of a similar conference this past year, when cutbacks in aid helped spur mass migration of refugees to Europe.</p>
                            <p>Still, it was unclear whether the new pledged aid would be sufficient to meet the need, which seems likely to grow substantially as more Syrians flee to Turkey, Lebanon or Jordan and as more asylum-seekers attempt the perilous trip to Europe with the coming of warmer weather.</p>
                            <p>One day before the conference, U.N.-led talks in Geneva aimed at achieving a cease-fire in Syria were abruptly suspended. The conflict has killed more than 250,000 people and displaced 11 million Syrians from their homes, including 4 million who have fled the country.</p>
